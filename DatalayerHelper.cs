    /// This class provides auxiliary methods to create ctrlX Datalayer client and provider connection strings to ctrlX CORE devices.
    /// It can be used for both running in an app build environment(QEMU VM) and within the snap environment on the ctrlX CORE.
    /// 
    /// Feel free to use it in your projects and to change it if necessary.
    ///
    /// For ease of use, the default values for IP address, user, password and SSL port are chosen to match the settings of a
    /// newly created ctrlX CORE device:
    ///
    ///     ip="192.168.1.1"
    ///     user="boschrexroth"
    ///     password="boschrexroth"
    ///     sslPort=443
    ///     
    /// with these variables, the tcp connection string can be formatted as follows:
    /// 
    ///     tcp://{user}:{password}@{ip}?sslport={sslPort}
    /// 
    /// If these values do not suit your use case, explicitly pass the parameters that require different values.
    /// 
    /// Here some examples:
    ///
    ///  1. ctrlX CORE or ctrlX CORE virtual with another IP address, user and password:
    ///    
    ///     var connectionString = DatalayerHelper.GetConnectionString(ip: "192.168.1.100", user: "admin", password: "-$_U/{X$aG}Z3/e<");
    ///
    ///  2. ctrlX CORE virtual with port forwarding running on the same host as the app build environment (QEMU VM):
    ///
    ///     var connectionString = DatalayerHelper.GetConnectionString(ip: "10.0.2.2", sslPort: 8443)
    ///
    ///     Remarks: 
    ///     10.0.2.2 is the IP address of the host from the point of view of the app build environment(QEMU VM).
    ///     8443 is the host port which is forwarded to the SSL port(=433) of the ctrlX CORE virtual
    ///     
    ///  3. ctrlX CORE virtual with port forwarding running on windows build environment (MS Visual Studio):
    ///  
    ///     var connectionString = DatalayerHelper.GetConnectionString(ip: "127.0.0.1", sslPort: 8443);
    ///     
    ///     Remarks: 
    ///     127.0.0.1 is the IP address of the ctrlX virtual on the windows host system.
    ///     8443 is the host port which is forwarded to the SSL port(=433) of the ctrlX CORE virtual
    ///
    /// IMPORTANT:
    /// You need not change the parameter settings before building a snap and installing the snap on a ctrlX CORE.
    /// The method detects the snap environment and uses automatically inter process communication.
    /// Therefor the connection string to the ctrlX Datalayer is: "ipc://"
